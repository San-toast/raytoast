# Tixxly

This is a fullstack project that allows a user to make a reservation for a movie on the website created. The user chooses a movie, then a time/date, their concessions, and finally submit their name.

# How It Works

The home page is connected to a movie database which displays recently released movies. Users reserve a time which is provided by our database on a table that holds information about each movie. Each new page stores the information selected by the user in variables that carry over until the end of their reservation process. After submitting all required information, a ticket is created and placed in another table of our databse and shown to the user.
